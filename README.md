### Recommendation
- To address this, it is recommended that the company implement targeted advertising and promotional campaigns during these months to boost sales performance.
- To incentivize increased engagement and drive higher patronage from other companies It is recommended that Company D be recognized and rewarded for its significant contribution. This approach is expected to enhance overall consumer activity and encourage similar levels of engagement from other companies.
- I recommend that she be recognized for Nancy Freehefar achievements through an appropriate award and considered for a promotion that reflects her outstanding contributions to the team.
- It is advisable to implement a structured supervisory plan for Jon kotas, including targeted support and training, to enhance his performance and achieve the team's goals.
- I recommend initiating targeted advertising campaigns in the West and South regions.
- To ensure optimal transaction efficiency and customer satisfaction . It is recommended that the company’s payment terminals or machines be maintained in excellent working condition. This will help support the predominant payment method and enhance the overall payment experience for consumers.
- To optimize shipping costs, I recommend focusing on the shipping companies with the lowest fees and exploring ways to improve their service or cost structure.
- To address the underperformance of these products, it is recommended that a further market analysis be conducted on the less product.
- The bottom five products should be thoroughly reviewed, and additional market analysis is recommended to identify the underlying reasons for their poor sales performance. This will help in developing strategies to improve their market appeal and overall performance.
- I recommend conducting a detailed market analysis of the grains and fruits & vegetables categories, as they currently rank lower compared to beverages, to identify opportunities for growth and improvement.
